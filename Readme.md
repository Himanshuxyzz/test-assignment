## 🚀 Things Implemented

- **WebView**: Implemented `react-native-webview` to render the inline html in the webview.
- **Deep Linking**: Implemented deep linking using `expo-linking` to navigate to the video player screen.
- **Custom Video Player**: Built on top of `expo-video`, featuring a fully custom-built UI for controls (play/pause, seek, fullscreen) and double tap to forward and backward.
- **Fullscreen Handling**: seamless orientation locking and unlocking using `expo-screen-orientation` since we are using custom controls so we needed custom implementation of fullscreen handling with orientation handling to view video in landscope mode.
- **Quality Switching**: Simulated video quality toggle (Auto, 720p, 480p, etc.).
- **Skeleton Loading**: A consistent, animated skeleton loading state using a generic composition pattern `Skeleton` will help in creating the skeleton component for any component.
- **Clean Architecture**: broke the repeated code into reusable component ensuring readability and maintainability with clear separation of concerns only where needed.
